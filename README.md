# Panda Project
## Introduction
This is a project as part of Code Institue's Hackathon in collaboration with [Trust in SODA](https://www.trustinsoda.com/). The theme of the hackathon is *Building an Accessible Workplace*. This was a team project in which I contributed to developing concepts, scope of project, wireframes, all of front end development, and a small part in back end. We didn't manage to fully finish the app upon submission. I then used this as a practice project finishing up the missing features.

## UX Design
### User Stories
* As a company, I want to be able to sign up / log in / log out
* As a company, I want to be able to create a profile to showcase my company's facilities and accessbility
* As a company, I want to be able to update the company profile(s) I have created
* As a company, I want to be able to delete the company profile(s) I have created
* As a visitor, I want to be able to search for a specific company, search by industry, or region
* As a visitor, I want to see a list of companies already available on the platform
* As a visitor, I want to see the detailed profile of the companies

### Strategy
The theme of the hackathon is *Building an Accessible Workplace: Create a tool that helps employers create a truly accessible workspace, or improve their recruitment and onboarding experience for every person.* Panda Project was created with the aim to create a platform where companies can write a detailed profile about their office, facilities, whether or not companies have assisstive technology or tools to help people with disabilities, and their HR policies and company culture in regards to inclusiveness and accessiveness. The goal of the platform is two-fold:
* From a user perspective, potential employees, especially people with disabilities, can have a glimps into what the company is like in order to mentally prepared themselves to navigate the scenes; or to give a better grounds for employer and potential employees to talk about the needs and support because it is sometimes not easy to talk about one's disability and wellness. People who have anxiety can also benefit well from knowing beforehand where and how the company is like before going to the interview/office.
* From an employer perspective, companies are pushed to RETHINK and perhaps REVAMP their workplace to make it more accessible to all.

### Scope

### Skeleton
* Color: The color scheme uses a neautral blue for any highlighting or colored elements on the app; black scripts on white background. Such simplicity of color scheme is to make it easy to read for everybody, including those with visual/color/reading problems.
* Logo features a panda because the idea is to use a symbol that represents chill and easiness. The image of a panda came to mind during the time constraints of the hackathon.
